<span class="style4">For the following problem, generate black-box test cases 
using Decision Table method. Test the given 
program using these test cases. </span></p>
<p class="style4">The software enables a passenger to select a seat in an 
airplane. The plane has 25 rows (numbered 1 to 25). The rows 1 to 6 are reserved 
for Business Class passengers and has 4 seats in each row. Each seat has a seat 
type defined as follows:</p>
<p class="style4">W A A W</p>
<p class="style4">where 'W' stands for Window seat and 'A' stands for Aisle 
seat. The rest of the 19 rows are meant for Economy Class passengers and has 6 
seats in each row. The seat arrangements in these rows are as follows:</p>
<p class="style4">W M A A M W</p>
<p class="style4">where, once again, 'W' stands for Window seat and 'A' stands 
for Aisle seat; 'M' stands for Middle seat. </p>
<p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style4">For seat selection, the passenger must input three 
parameters: </p>
<ol>
	<li class="style4">A ticket number (ranging from 1001 to 1138, both 
	inclusive) -Ticket numbers 1001 to 1024 are reserved for Business Class 
	passengers and the ticket numbers 1025 to 1138 are meant for Economy Class 
	passengers.</li>
	<li class="style4">Row number (ranging from 1 to 25, both inclusive) </li>
	<li class="style4">Seat type (a character 'W', 'A' or 'M') </li>
</ol>
<p>If the parameters are all valid and if the selected seat is not reserved 
before, the software assigns the seat for this ticket number.
<span class="auto-style1">Some examples</span> of invalid seat selections are as 
follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Business Class passenger requests for a Middle seat.</li>
	<li>Both Window seats in a particular row are already selected by other 
	passengers and a passenger wants a Window seat on the same row.</li>
	<li>An Economy Class passenger requests for a seat in one of the first 6 
	rows - remember that these rows are reserved for Business Class passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The software displays the current seat assignments after all seat selection 
requests are done.</p>
<p><a href="SeatAssignmentDecisionTableAssignment.class">Click here</a> to get the program for this problem. The 
program is written in Java. Install Java run-time environment on your machine if 
it is not already installed. You should run the program from the command line 
using the following command:</p>
<p class="style5">java SeatAssignmentDecisionTableAssignment &lt;input file name&gt; &lt;output file name&gt;</p>
<p>The input file should contain the three input parameters in that order 
separated by spaces. The output file will be a text file which will contain the 
results. You should extract the output from this file and use it for your 
report.</p>
<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>
<p>You must submit the report which includes (1) the decision table, and (3) the result of 
your testing process in the following format:</p>
<table id="table1" width="100%" border="1">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td rowspan="2" align="center"><font size="4">Test case #</font></td>
		<td colspan="3" align="center"><font size="4">Input Parameters</font></td>
		<td rowspan="2" align="center"><font size="4">Expected Output</font></td>
		<td rowspan="2" align="center"><font size="4">Actual Output</font></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td align="center">Ticket number</td>
		<td align="center">Row number</td>
		<td align="center">Seat type</td>
	</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Notice that the actual output must be EXACTLY the same as displayed by the 
program, and not in your own terms.</p>
